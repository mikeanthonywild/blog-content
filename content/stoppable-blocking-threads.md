Title: Stopping blocking threads in Python using gevent (sort of)
Date: 2015-08-20 15:43

**tl;dr: The [gist here](https://gist.github.com/mikeanthonywild/4e4784f1974d21f366d5) provides a replacement `threading.Thread` class with a `stop()` method using Gevent and greenlets. It should also be prefixed by saying these aren't proper 'threads', but 'greenlets'.**

Something which crops up [time](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/323972/is-there-any-way-to-kill-a-thread-in-python) and [time again](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5019436/python-how-to-terminate-a-blocking-thread), is how to stop a blocking thread in Python. Take the following example to spawn a blocking thread in the background:

    :::python
    import threading
    import time


    t = threading.Thread(target=time.sleep, args=[10])
    t.start()
    print("Waiting 10s to exit...")
    print("Press <Ctrl-C> to stop thread")
    while True:
        try:
            time.sleep(1)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            exit("Keyboard interrupt - waiting for thread to finish...")

Output:

    :::console
    Waiting 10s to exit...
    Press <Ctrl-C> to stop thread
    ^C
    Keyboard interrupt - waiting for thread to finish...
    [...]

Notice that even though we catch the `^C` escape sequence, the main thread won't exit until the sleep thread has finished, even if you mash `^C`. A quick fix in this case would be to set the `t.daemon ` property to `True` before the thread is started, meaning that the main thread won't wait for child threads to finish before exiting. This is fine for trivial examples like the one above, but can become a real issue when we start dealing with sockets and the like. 

Here's a more realistic example:

    :::python
    import threading
    import socket
    import time


    class StoppableThread(threading.Thread):
        def run(self):
            s = socket.socket()
            s.bind(('127.0.0.1', 0))
            s.listen(1)
            print("Listening on {}:{}".format(s.getsockname()[0], s.getsockname()[1]))

            conn, addr = s.accept()

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        t = StoppableThread()
        t.start()
        print("Press <Ctrl-C> to stop thread")
        while True:
            try:
                time.sleep(1)
            except KeyboardInterrupt:
                exit("Keyboard interrupt - waiting for thread to finish...")

Output:

    :::console
    Press <Ctrl-C> to stop thread
    Listening on 127.0.0.1:65309
    ^C
    Keyboard interrupt - waiting for thread to finish...
    [...]

Using `t.daemon = True` on a socket server thread can lead to the socket not being released â€“ thus it's impossible to restart the server as Python won't be able to bind to the port you were using (ignoring the `SO_REUSEADDR` flag). Additionally, sometimes Python can't kill its child threads and you end up having to force-kill the entire process, leading to the afformentioned issue. Yet, if we use `t.daemon = False`, we have to kill the whole process anyway, because it's blocked by `s.accept()` until something connects. 

### Solution

The widely-accepted solution is to set a timeout on our blocking functions so we can periodically check a `threading.Event` which we set from the main thread to indicate we want the child thread to stop. Unfortunately this solution is a little clunky:

    :::python
    class StoppableThread(threading.Thread):
        def __init__(self):
            super(StoppableThread, self).__init__()
            self._stop = threading.Event()

        def run(self):
            s = socket.socket()
            s.settimeout(1)             # Socket will raise exception if nothing received
            s.bind(('127.0.0.1', 0))
            s.listen(1)
            print("Listening on {}:{}".format(s.getsockname()[0], s.getsockname()[1]))

            while True:
                try:
                    conn, addr = s.accept()
                except socket.error:
                    # Check for stop signal
                    if self._stop.is_set():
                        print("Shutting down cleanly...")
                        s.close()
                        return
                    
Now when we catch a `KeyboardInterrupt` we can trigger the server thread to stop:

    :::python
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        t._stop.set()
        exit("Keyboard interrupt - waiting for thread to finish...")

### A better solution using Gevent and greenlets

The official description of a greenlet is rather confusing given the context of this post, so a simple example will be used to explain it instead (taken from http://sdiehl.github.io/gevent-tutorial/):

    :::python
    import time
    import gevent
    from gevent import select

    start = time.time()
    tic = lambda: 'at %1.1f seconds' % (time.time() - start)

    def gr1():
        # Busy waits for a second, but we don't want to stick around...
        print('Started Polling: %s' % tic())
        select.select([], [], [], 2)
        print('Ended Polling: %s' % tic())

    def gr2():
        # Busy waits for a second, but we don't want to stick around...
        print('Started Polling: %s' % tic())
        select.select([], [], [], 2)
        print('Ended Polling: %s' % tic())

    def gr3():
        print("Hey lets do some stuff while the greenlets poll, %s" % tic())
        gevent.sleep(1)

    gevent.joinall([
        gevent.spawn(gr1),
        gevent.spawn(gr2),
        gevent.spawn(gr3),
    ])

Output:

    :::console
    Started Polling: at 0.0 seconds
    Started Polling: at 0.0 seconds
    Hey lets do some stuff while the greenlets poll, at 0.0 seconds
    Ended Polling: at 2.0 seconds
    Ended Polling: at 2.0 seconds

What this shows is that Gevent provides pseudo-concurrency by context switching on blocking functions like `select()`. The keen-eyed observer will notice that the snippet above uses a special `gevent.select`, a version of the standard Python implementation which has been [monkeypatched](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5626193/what-is-a-monkey-patch) to behave co-operatively to allow the switching behaviour seen above. It's also possible to just import a standard blocking Python module and patch it at runtime like so:

    :::python
    import time

    from gevent import monkey
    monkey.patch_all()

    time.sleep(1)   # Now it can be used inside a greenlet!

This is significant, because without the monkeypatching, it wouldn't be possible to implement a stoppable thread as easily. Critically, Gevent also provides a `Greenlet.kill()` method, which stops the greenlet from executing.

#### Putting everything together

We can put all of this together to obtain our stoppable thread:

1. Use `gevent.spawn()` to spawn a new greenlet with the thread's `run()` method.
2. Call the greenlet's `kill()` method to stop the 'thread'.
3. Release all the resources used by the greenlet.

An example stoppable thread class is presented here:

        threading.Thread class geared towards cleanly stopping blocking

Why use greenlets when we can just implement timeouts and poll our stop flag, as above? Because it's possible to get a stoppable thread using one line of code, instead of implementing timeouts etc. Simple changing `class StoppableThread(threading.Thread):` to `class StoppableThread(betterthreads.Thread):` does the trick:

    :::python
    import betterthreads
    import socket
    import time


    class StoppableThread(betterthreads.Thread):
        def run(self):
            s = socket.socket()
            s.bind(('127.0.0.1', 0))
            s.listen(1)
            print("Listening on {}:{}".format(s.getsockname()[0], s.getsockname()[1]))

            conn, addr = s.accept()

        def shutdown()
            print("Shutting down cleanly...")
            conn.close()
            s.close()


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        t = StoppableThread()
        t.start()
        print("Press <Ctrl-C> to stop thread")
        while True:
            try:
                time.sleep(1)
            except KeyboardInterrupt:
                exit("Keyboard interrupt - waiting for thread to finish...")

Output:

    :::console
    Press <Ctrl-C> to stop thread
    Listening on 127.0.0.1:65309
    ^C
    Keyboard interrupt - waiting for thread to finish...
    Shutting down cleanly...
    
    $

`betterthreads.Thread` implements the same interface as `threading.Thread`, so it should be a drop-in replacement.
