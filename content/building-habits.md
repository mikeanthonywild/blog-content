Title: Building good habits
Date: 2015-07-24 19:31

Writing is something that I always used to enjoy as a child but tapered off the older I got, whether a result of diminishing free time or increasing distractions. Sporadically I will try to start writing again, but always seem to get side-tracked. Just in trying to write this post I have found countless ways to avoid the task at hand:

* Refining the blog's style and tuning the web server
* Looking at the full range of Markdown / Pelican metadata options
* Deciding which title capitalisation style to use

Something that has always troubled me is being ever-concious of what other people might think upon reading my writing, leading me to spend most time picking words carefully to engineer others' perceptions of me.

Moving forwards, this new blog serves two main purposes: to get into the habit of writing every day, and a place to note down important information for future reference - hopefully with the intention of being of some use to other people too. While past blogs have always been written with others in mind, this one is purely for me â€“ if it helps someone else along the way then all the better.

Among other things, writing every day is a good habit I wish to build; this post is the first step along that path.
